### Ika is a purely handwritten programming language which I designed to learn how to write compilers in Rust.

## Features
The ika compiler compiles the Ika source code file into an LLVM intermediate representation and then compiles it into an executable file

## Usage

compile the Ika source file:
```
ika [-o a.out] hello.ika
```

help command:
```
ika -h
```

show the AST:
```
ika -a
```

show the tokens:
```
ika -t
```

show the source code:
```
ika -s
```
